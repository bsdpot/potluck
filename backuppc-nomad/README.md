# Overview

This is a BackupPC jail that can be started with ```pot``` but it can also be deployed via ```nomad```.

The storage directory is in ```/var/db/BackupPC```.
It is suggested that this directory is mounted from outside the jail when it is run as a ```nomad``` task so that it is persistent (see example below).

The admin interface can be accessed via web browser through port 80.

For more details about ```nomad```images, see [about potluck](https://potluck.honeyguide.net/micro/about-potluck/).

The jail exposes these parameters that can either be set via the environment or by setting the ```cook```parameters (the latter either via ```nomad```, see example below, or by editing the downloaded jails ```pot.conf``` file):

| Environment      | cook parameter     | Content      |
| :--------------- | :----------------: | :-----------|
| PASSWORD         | -p              | Password for user ```admin``` in the web interface |

**Note: The jail does not yet send any BackupPC emails. Flavour patches for this or for making the configuration more persistent (see job description below) are welcome :) ...**

# Nomad Job Description Example

It is suggested to mount the jail directories ```/var/db/BackupPC``` and ```/usr/local/etc/backuppc/pc``` from outside as these contain the backup database and the host specific settings which both probably should be persistent.

Also, it is suggested to copy in the BackupPC ```hosts``` file (as this will otherwise be recreated on each job scheduling, so also edit this file by hand outside of the jail and *not* via the admin GUI as the changes otherwise will be lost when the jail is rescheduled by ```nomad```). The main BackupPC configuration will be recreated as well, so store configuration in your per host settings that are stored in the mounted in directory ```/usr/local/etc/backuppc/pc```.

Last not least, if you use ```ssh``` to access clients, you probably also want to copy your private/public key pair to ```/home/backuppc/.ssh``` so the BackupPC server can access your clients.
