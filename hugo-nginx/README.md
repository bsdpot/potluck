# Overview

This is a flavour containing the ```hugo``` website builder and nginx, a webserver.

This is a minimal config with no SSL configured as this is expected to be handled by a reverse proxy.

It has been put together specifically for use by the https://potluck.honeyguide.net website, however it could be utilised for any site.

You can adjust this flavour and rebuild your own pot image if you have other requirements.

# Disclaimer

It is advised to run this image behind a proxy. The directory permissions on the hugo folder are very permissive to allow a jenkins user in another pot image to do stuff. Run the hugo-nginx and jenkins pot images behind a proxy with access control.

# Installation

* Create a ZFS data set on the parent system beforehand
  ```zfs create -o mountpoint=/mnt/<sitename> zroot/jaildata_hugo```
* Create your local jail from the image or the flavour files.
* Clone the local jail
* Mount in the ZFS data set you created:
  ```pot mount-in -p <jailname> -d /mnt/<sitename> -m /mnt```
* Optionally copy in jenkins user SSH public key:
  ```pot copy-in -p <jailname> -s /path/to/jenkins/id_rsa.pub -d /root/jenkins.pub```
* Optionally copy in customfile.tgz:
  ```pot copy-in -p <jailname> -s /path/to/customfile.tgz -d /root/customfile.tgz```
* Optionally export the ports after creating the jail:
  ```pot export-ports -p <jailname> -e 80:80```
* Adjust to your environment:
  ```
  sudo pot set-env -p <jailname> \
  -E NODENAME=name \
  -E DATACENTER=datacenter \
  -E CONSULSERVERS=<comma-deliminated list of consul servers> \
  -E SERVERNAME=<fqdn> \
  -E IP=<IP of potbuilder VM> \
  -E SITENAME=<site name> \
  -E GITEMAIL=<git user email> \
  -E GITUSER=<git username> \
  [ -E CUSTOMDIR=<custom dir inside huge sitename> ] \
  [ -E CUSTOMFILE=1 -E IMPORTKEYS=1 ] \
  [ -E THEMEADJUST=1 ] \
  [ -E BUCKETHOST=<ip or hostname S3 host> ] \
  [ -E BUCKETUSER=<s3 username> ] \
  [ -E BUCKETPASS=<s3 password> ] \
  [ -E BUCKETNAME=<name of bucket> ] \
  [ -E BUCKETCRON=<any value enables cron sync to S3 bucket> ] \
  [ -E REMOTELOG=<IP syslog-ng server> ]
  ```

The NODENAME parameter is the name of the node.

The DATACENTER parameter is the name of the datacenter. The REGION parameter is to set "east" or "west" or "global" (default).

The CONSULSERVERS parameter is a comma-deliminated list of IP addresses for the consul server or cluster. Do not include spaces!

e.g. ```CONSULSERVERS="10.0.0.2"``` or ```CONSULSERVERS="10.0.0.2,10.0.0.3,10.0.0.4,10.0.0.5,10.0.0.6"```

The GOSSIPKEY parameter is the gossip encryption key for consul agent.

The SERVERNAME parameter is the fully qualified domain name to configure nginx with.

The IP parameter is the IP address of the pot image.

The SITENAME parameter is the name of the hugo site and affects directory naming.

The GITEMAIL parameter is the email address to use for a git username.

The GITUSER parameter is the git username associated with the email address.

The optional CUSTOMDIR parameter is a custom directory to create inside the hugo installation in SITENAME.

The optional CUSTOMFILE parameter, if set to 1, will copy in your own customfile.tgz which will be extracted to ```/mnt/{SITENAME}/```. This would be a custom config.toml, static microblog posts or about.md pages and images for static dir.

The optional IMPORTKEYS parameter, if set to 1, will add the copied in pubkey to authenticated_keys.
Copy in the applicable id_rsa.pub as part of the pot setup and start process.

The optional THEMEADJUST parameter, if set to 1, will make changes specific to http://potluck.honeyguide.net.

The optional parameters BUCKETHOST, BUCKETUSER, BUCKETPASS and BUCKETNAME refer to credentials for minio-client. This feature is not fully developed yet.

The optional parameter BUCKETCRON will enable a cron job to sync files to S3 bucket if set to any value.

The optional REMOTELOG parameter is for a remote syslog service, such as via the `loki` or `beast-of-argh` images on potluck site.

# Usage
Start hugo manually (not necessary):
```
cd /mnt/sitename && hugo
```

To access ```hugo```:
* http://hugo-host-name

The default site is blank.

# customfile.tgz

If you wish to include a custom setup for hugo, you can create a file ```customfile.tgz``` with the following folder structure:

```
./config.toml
./static
./static/mylogo.png
./content/info.md
./content/micro/news.md
./content/micro/about.md
```

Make sure to copy-in to /root/customfile.tgz and set ```-E CUSTOMFILE=1``` in the parameters.

# Persistent storage

To use persistent storage make sure to mount-in a pre-configured data set to /mnt/(your-sitename).
