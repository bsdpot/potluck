# Overview

This is a ```nginx``` jail that can be deployed via ```nomad```.

You need to create persistent storage, with a subdirectory www. Place an index.php or index.html file, or whole website, in the www directory.

Mount in the persistant storage with www subdirectory to /usr/local/www/stdwebsite in the job file as below.

```nginx``` will serve files from this location by default.

For more details about ```nomad``` images, see [about potluck](https://potluck.honeyguide.net/micro/about-potluck/).

Since the service is expected to be published via ```consul``` and a web proxy like ```traefik```, plus frontend ```haproxy``` no HTTPS configuration is specified in ```nginx``` as it is expected that this is happening in the web proxy. HTTPS is merely enabled.

# Installation

# Options
You can pass in parameters to the image to set variables.

-E SERVERNAME or `-s servername`.
