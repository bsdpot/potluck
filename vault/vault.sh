# Altered by Michael Gmelin
#
# EDIT THE FOLLOWING FOR NEW FLAVOUR:
# 1. RUNS_IN_NOMAD - true or false
# 2. Create a matching <flavour> file with this <flavour>.sh file that
#    contains the copy-in commands for the config files from <flavour>.d/
#    Remember that the package directories don't exist yet, so likely copy to /root
# 3. Adjust package installation between BEGIN & END PACKAGE SETUP
# 4. Check tarball extraction works for you between BEGIN & END EXTRACT TARBALL
# 5. Adjust jail configuration script generation between BEGIN & END COOK
#    Configure the config files that have been copied in where necessary

# Set this to true if this jail flavour is to be created as a nomad (i.e. blocking) jail.
# You can then query it in the cook script generation below and the script is installed
# appropriately at the end of this script
RUNS_IN_NOMAD=false
