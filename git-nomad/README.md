# Overview

This is a Git jail that can be started with ```pot``` but it can also be deployed via ```nomad```.

The git user home directory is in ```/var/db/git``` where also a directory ```.ssh``` for authorized key access resides.
It is suggested that this directory is mounted from outside the jail when it is run as a ```nomad``` task so that it is persistent (see example below).

Since some ```fusefs``` filesystems (e.g. ```s3fs```) make setting up correct permissions for mounts impossible at the moment due to bugs, ```sshd``` is run with ```StrictModes no``` in ```/etc/ssh/sshd_config```.

Git is started as blocking task when the jail is started (see ```git-nomad+4.sh```).

The image also is slimmed (see ```git-nomad+3.sh```)

For more details about ```nomad```images, see [about potluck](https://potluck.honeyguide.net/micro/about-potluck/).

# Nomad Job Description Example

It is suggested to mount the jail directory ```/var/db/git``` from outside as this contains the git database and the ```.ssh/authorized_keys``` file for access:

You can also copy-in an SSH public key to ```/root/publickey``` exactly and it will be automatically added to the git user ```.ssh/authorized_keys``` file. This will overwrite the file each time, so add all keys to the copy-in file.

```
job "examplegit" {
  datacenters = ["datacenter"]
  type        = "service"

  group "group1" {
    count = 1

    task "www1" {
      driver = "pot"

      service {
        tags = ["git"]
        name = "git-example-service"
        port = "ssh"

         check {
            type     = "tcp"
            name     = "tcp"
            interval = "60s"
            timeout  = "30s"
          }
      }

      config {
        image = "https://potluck.honeyguide.net/git-nomad"
        pot = "git-nomad-amd64-14_0"
        tag = "1.15.1"
        command = "/usr/local/bin/cook"
        args = ["-n","gitnomad"]

        copy = [
          "/path/to/id_rsa.pub:/root/publickey"
        ]

        mount = [
          "/mnt/s3/web/git:/var/db/git"
        ]

        port_map = {
          ssh = "22"
        }

      }

      resources {
        cpu = 200
        memory = 64

        network {
          mbits = 10
          port "ssh" {}
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
